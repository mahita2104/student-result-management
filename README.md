# Student Result Management System 
PROBLEM STATEMENT - Develop an Student Result Management System for Examination Department of IGDTUW using C++
# Why we opt for this problem statement ?
Effective student result management system is important for any educational institution as it **helps to monitor and access academic performance** of the students at a single platform . With increasing number of students in institutions, it becomes difficult and a time consuming task to handle all the data and result processing is delayed . Results are of utmost importance to students and the institution itself so they require absolute accuracy.Manually handling a large amounts of data is prone to human errors.So by keeping all this in our mind,we prepared our project on student result management system.Using a computerized system for result management can provide several benefits such as **accurate generation of reports on time , ease in data entry and updation and decrease human labour**.
# Features of our Project
1. **Create, Display, Update and Delete** student records.
2. **Create, Display, Update and Delete** course records.
3. **Create, Display, Update and Delete** exam records.
4. Assign course(s) to student
5. Assign exam(s) to course
6. **Create, Display, Update and Delete** student's exam scores
7. Calculate student's total marks and percentage
8. Display individual student's result
9. Display course-wise result
10. Display overall result
# Tools we used for making our project
We used visual studio code as our coding platform. we opted for C++ programming language because from our point of view it was easy to articulate.
We used canva for preparing our presentation as it includes various features helps in making the presentation attractive.

# Challenges we ran into
Since we were beginners, we had to get a grip over our coding language in a short span of time.
We did have some issues with understanding the test cases but in the end we were able to crack them after few trials.All in all it was a great learning experience.
# Accomplishments we are proud of

"Every worthwhile accomplishment, big or little, has its stages of drudgery and triumph : a beginning, a sturggle, and a victory." - Mahatma Gandhi

We were able to successfully complete our project. We could pass all the test cases which was really nice! We feel more confident after participating in this hackathon. 
# What we learned
We became efficient in C++ programming language.It has boosted up our confidence and has motivated us to participate in more hackathons.
We have discovered various new features in canva which will hepl us with our future projects.It has given great exposure to coding competitons.
It has increased our competitive spirit. Looking at other teams projects has inspired us alot.
# What's next for our project
We want our student result management project to become a common platform for various educational institutions. We want to add new features as well as AI tools.
